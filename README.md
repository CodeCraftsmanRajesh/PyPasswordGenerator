# 🔐 Password Generator in Python

A simple Python program that generates a random and secure password based on user-defined criteria. The user specifies how many letters, symbols, and digits the password should contain, and the program creates a randomized password accordingly.

## 📌 Features

- User-defined password length
- Custom number of:
  - Letters (uppercase & lowercase)
  - Symbols
  - Digits
- Randomized and secure password generation
- Beginner-friendly Python project

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python 3
- Built-in random module

## 🚀 How It Works

1. The program asks the user for:
    - Number of letters
    - Number of symbols
    - Number of digits

2. It randomly selects characters from predefined lists.
3. All selected characters are shuffled.
4. A final random password is generated and displayed.

## ▶️ Usage

Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/password-generator-python.git
```

Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd password-generator-python
```

Run the program:
```bash

```

Enter the required inputs when prompted.

📂 Example Output
```bash
Enter number of letters: 5
Enter number of symbols: 2
Enter number of digits: 3

Generated Password: aB#9d@7Q2
```
